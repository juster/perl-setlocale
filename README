THIS IS NOT FOR USE IN PRODUCTION DO NOT RUN make install.

This is only for testing purposes to explore a recent bug in perl
regarding version number parsing, locales, and the Gtk2 module,
among others. I wrote this so I don't have to install Gtk2 and
its miriad dependencies in a VirtualBox in order to test something.

USAGE

Remember, whichever perl you use to run the Makefile.PL will be
the one that this module is compiled with. I patched perl and
installed it under $HOME/opt in my situation.

perl Makefile.PL
make
perl test.pl

I wrote my own simple test script (without Test::More) because for
the most part Test::More is overkill. I don't need a test harness
here.

On a patched perl everything passes. On an unpatched perl everything
but the last test should pass. The last test should emit an error.
