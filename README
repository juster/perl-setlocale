THIS IS NOT FOR USE IN PRODUCTION DO NOT RUN make install.

DESCRIPTION

This is only for testing purposes to explore a recent bug in perl
regarding version number parsing, locales, and the Gtk2 module,
among others. I wrote this so I don't have to install Gtk2 and
its miriad dependencies in a VirtualBox in order to test something.

USAGE

Remember, whichever perl you use to run the Makefile.PL will be
the one that this module is compiled with. I patched perl and
installed it under $HOME/opt in my situation.

Test.pl is hard-coded for the version of perl I am testing (5.20.0)
as well as the comma using locale I am testing (fr_FR). You may
need to change these for your situation.

perl Makefile.PL
make
perl test.pl

TESTING

I wrote my own simple test script (without Test::More) because for
the most part Test::More is overkill. I don't need a test harness
here.

On a patched perl everything passes. On an unpatched perl everything
but the "require 5.020" test should pass. The second to last test will
error out and the very last test won't be run.
